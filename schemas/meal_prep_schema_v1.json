The preparation steps for the items going into the oven should therefore also go first.Assume that there is only 1 oven to be used. Make sure to include instructions to let the cook know to perform steps while items are cooking in the oven. Create sections and sub-sections using heading #1 and #2 markups as required. In each section, make the instructions detailed, focusing on the quantity, unit and ingredient name, key action, and duration. Summarize the key action followed by the detail. Example: <Step summary> - <Step detail>. Bold the step and return the text in markdown. Where it makes sense, reference the name of the recipe that the instruction is for. "
